# CrystalCollector
Crystal Collector involved a Target Score and four crystals, all of which are assigned random numbers at the start of each game. The Target Score and Crystal values reset each time the game is restarted.

The user will select crystals in an attempt to have their Current Score match the Target Score. The crystal values are hidden from the user until each crystal is selected.

If the user's Current Score goes above the Target Score, they lose. If the user matches the Target Score, they win.  Both wins and loses are tallied.
